In the program, we first declare a character array command to store the command entered by the user, an array of strings args to store the arguments to the command (in this case, just the command itself), an integer pid to store the process ID of the child process, and an integer status to store the exit status of the child process.

The while loop in the program runs indefinitely until the user terminates the program (e.g., with Ctrl-C). In each iteration of the loop, we prompt the user to enter a command with the printf function, and read the input with the fgets function. We use fgets instead of scanf to read the input because fgets is more robust and can handle input with spaces.

Next, we remove the newline character from the input using strcspn and '\0' so that we can pass the command as an argument to execv.

We then call fork() to create a new child process. If fork() returns a negative value, it means that the child process was not created successfully, so we print an error message using perror() and exit the program with an error code. If fork() returns 0, it means that we are in the child process, so we use execv() to run the command specified by the user. The first argument to execv() is the path to the executable file we want to run (in this case, the command entered by the user), and the second argument is an array of strings that represent the arguments to the command. Since we're only passing the command itself as an argument, the array of arguments contains just the command and a NULL terminator.

If execv() returns, it means that an error occurred, so we print an error message using perror() and exit the child process with an error code. If fork() returns a positive value, it means that we are in the parent process, so we call wait() to wait for the child process to exit. The wait() function waits for any child process to exit, and stores information about the child process's exit status in the status variable. We don't need to use the exit status in this program, so we don't do anything with it.
